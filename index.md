<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am Fujun Wang, a Ph.D. student at University of Potsdam [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/geo/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Peter van der Beek]( https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/geo/institute/members/van-der-beek-peter) and Prof.[Edward Sobel](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/geo/institute/members/sobel-edward). My research focuses on exploring the links between climate, erosion, and long-term landscape evolution utilizing low-temperature thermochronology and novel numerical methods combined with geomorphic data. Study areas mainly refer to the western Tarim Basin, Pamir, and Tianshan.


## Research Interest

- **Coupling interaction between tectonics, climate, and erosion:** between the Pamir and Tianshan
- **Evolution of fold-and-thrust belts** in South Tianshan and North Pamir
- **Thermochronology:** Fission track, U-Th/He, 4He/3He
- **Sedimentary provenance** of the southeastern Junggar during the late Mesozoic
- **Tectono-magmatic events** of the Tianshan Orogen during the late Mesozoic
- **Exhumation and preservation of porphyry deposit** in the West Junggar
